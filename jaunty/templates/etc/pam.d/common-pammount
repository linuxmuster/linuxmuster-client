# Include this file in every /etc/pam.d/SERVICE you use for login:
# [...]
# @include common-auth
# @include common-session
# [...]
# # added for libpam-mount
# @include common-pammount
#
# Make sure that the common-auth and common-session includes are
# above the common-pammount include (just as in the example above).

# replace "optional" with "required" if a user must mount the specified
# volumes, for example the home directory

# make sure that there is no PAM module loaded with a "sufficient"
# priority before these entries, else the pam_mount module is not
# executed

# for configuration details about different login programs see
# /usr/share/doc/libpam-mount/README.Debian.gz
